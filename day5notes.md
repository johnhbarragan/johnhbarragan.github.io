# CSS Basics

CSS stands for Cascading Styles Sheets and can  be used to control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser. 

You can mark up HTML but also SVG and XML. 

At most basic level, CSS consists of two components - properties and values. examples: font-size, background-color
  * When a property is paired with a value, it is called a declaration

Inside curly braces, we can make one or more declarations which take the form of property and value pairs and each pair specifies a property of the element we are selecting. 
  
  -Before the colon, we have the property and ter the color, the value

## Adding CSS to our document

Create a file in the same folder as your HTML doc and save it as styles.css

To link css, add the following line somewhere inside the **HEAD** of the document: 

" <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> " 

CSS can be added via external stylesheet, interneral stylesheet or inline styles (avoid using this way)

  * Declaration blocks paired with selectors (selects the HTML element that we are going to style) to produce CSS rulesets
