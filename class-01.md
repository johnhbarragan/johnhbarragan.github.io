# How to build a site

The first step in designing a website is understanding your target audience. It's important to design a website with different consumers perspectives in mind. The pool of consumers will likely have a wide range of varying traits so creating consumer personas can be a helpful step in grouping similar sets of users to better hone in on user motivations and goals.

### Why is this important?

  * You know **WHO** is coming to your site
  * You know **WHY** they are coming to your site and what information they are seeking
  * It provide cues on how to best design a website 


Useful tools to mapping out site are a **Site Map** and a **Wireframe**

  * Site map: diagram that will show how pages can be grouped
  * Wireframe: simple sketch of the info that needs to go on each page. Think about this as a sketch of a newspaper layout


# HTML

HTML desbribes the structures of web pages. Think about a newspaper or Microsoft work document, each has a beginning, middle, and an end. HTML code lives inside angled brackets. For example: `<body></body>` or `<head></head>`

### HTML5

There have been several versions of HTML with the newest version trying to improve on the last. HTML5 is indroducing a new set of elements that improve efficiency when structuring a page. The new elements provide clearer code. Important to note that some older browers might not support newer HTML features.

# JavaScript

# HTML, CSS, JavaScript working together

HTML provides structure, CSS enhances HTML and adds a presentation layer, and JS adds interactivity and makes the site more dynamic
