# Structuring web page with HTML

## Wireframing
Wifeframing is a practice which allows UX designers to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. When designing for the screen, you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code

## HTML Basics
HTML is markup language that defines the **STRUCTURE** of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way. 

Anatomy of an HTML document can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) 

Familiarity with HTML tags and body structure will come with practice. 

CSS and Javascript will build on HTML. Here is a way to think about them in relation to one another

  - HTML = Skeleton/Frame or Black and White/Text/Not Pretty

  - CSS = Interior Designer/Presentation or colors/text size/picture and sizing

  - Javascript = Smarthome or bells and whistles/fun/moving pictures
