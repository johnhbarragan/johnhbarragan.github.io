# Creating Charts
You can great charts with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5's canvas element to draw the graph on a page. 

You need to download Chart.js (insert `<script>` in HTML file) along with a single `<canvas>` node to render the chart

# Basic usage of Canvas:
`<canvas>` only has tow attributes: width and height. Unlike `<img>`, canvas requires a closing tag `</canvas>`. 

Canvas only supports two primitive shapes: rectanlges and paths (lists of points connected by lines). All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths. 

You can draw rectangles, paths, triangles, arcs using `functions`
