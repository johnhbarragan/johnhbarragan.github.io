# What is Git?

Git is a DVS (Distributed Version Control Systems) that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. It is used for local usage and edited versions are then uploaded to the cloud, or Github. I think about Git as a localized shared google doc. Edits and past versions can be seen, notes can be added to changes, and you can upload your work to the cloud, making it a great collaborative tool. 

Git does not need internet connection!

Imporant actions in the Git workflow are **ADD**, **COMMIT**, and **PUSH**

  * Add - Adding edits and other changes to your file

  * Commit - Each time you have saved a changed version of your project

  * Push - Uploading saved local project to the cloud


## Github Cheatsheet

- Adding files (after making changes): **git add .** (the . adds ALL the files, otherwise you can specify the exact file name)

- Checking the status of your git process **git status**

- Committing your files **git commit -m "your message here"**

- pushing your code to GitHub **git push origin main**
