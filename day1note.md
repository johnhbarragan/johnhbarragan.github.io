Markdown is a lightweight and easy to use syntax for styling all forms or writing on the Github platform. Mostly, Markdown is just 
regular text with a few non alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *

1. ** **  = Bold
2. '* *' = Italic (remove apostrophe)
3. ~ ~ = Strikethrough
4. '>' = quoting text (remove apostrophe)
5. Brackets(URL link)
