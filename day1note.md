# Learning Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy to use syntax for styling all forms or writing on the Github platform. Github is a host site for software development and it helps build websites through efficient/simple coding. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *
