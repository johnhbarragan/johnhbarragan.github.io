# Growth Mindset
After reading the following [article](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset), here are my thoughts...

## My definition of Growth Mindset: 

*Growth mindset is thinking about a problem or a challenge through a positive light. Hard work and dedication will often lead to positive results. While there may be challenges along the way, it is important to remain humble and learn from criticism. The opposite of a growth mindset is a fixed mindset which often leads to unfulfilled potential.*

###### Reminders to maintain Growth Mindset
* Listen to criticism and incorporate feedback 
* Think about every project as a learning opportunity vs a waste of time
* If I get frustrated with a problem, it's OK take a break and get back after it! 


# Learning Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy to use syntax for styling all forms or writing on the Github platform. Github is a host site for software development and it helps build websites through efficient/simple coding. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or * 

## Basic Writing cheatsheet
1. ** **  = Bold
2. '* *' = Italic (remove apostrophe)
3. ~ ~ = Strikethrough
4. '>' = quoting text (remove apostrophe)
5. Brackets(URL link)
6. unordered lists can start with - or *
