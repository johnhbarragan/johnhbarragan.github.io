# Growth Mindset

Hi my name is Johnny Barragan. 

## Here is my definition of Growth Mindset: 

*Growth mindset is thinking about a problem or a challenge through a positive light. Hard work and dedication will often lead to positive results. While there may be challenges along the way, it is important to remain humble and learn from criticism. The opposite of a growth mindset is a fixed mindset which often leads to unfulfilled potential.*

###### Reminders to maintain Growth Mindset
- Listen to criticism and incorporate feedback 
- Think about every project as a learning opportunity vs a waste of time
- If I get frustrated with a problem, it's OK take a break and get back after it! 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/johnhbarragan/johnhbarragan.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/johnhbarragan/johnhbarragan.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
