# What is a text editor?

The text editor is one the most important tools for an aspiring developer. A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access through a web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the texxt that you write to build a web site.

## How to choose a text editor
* Code Completion
  * Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos

* Syntax Highlighting
  * Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text

* a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue

* the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them

**EVERY COMPUTER HAS ITS OWN TEXT EDITOR** - Mac = Text Edit Windows = Notepad

**THIRD PARTY OPTIONS** - Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text.

## Text editors vs IDEs

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If youâ€™ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one software package
