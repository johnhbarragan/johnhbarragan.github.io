# Tables
Table represents info on a grid format. Each block in the grid is referred to as a `table cell`. 

## Basic table structure
  * `<table>` = used to create table 
  * `<tr>`= the start of each row using this tag which stands for table row
  * `<td>` = each cell of a table 
  * `<th>` = used like `<td>`but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row
  * `colspan` = SPANNING COLUMNS - attribute can be used on th or td element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across 
  * `rowspan`= SPANNING ROWS

  ### Long tables
  * `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` help distinguish between the main content of a table and the first and last rows 

  ## Objects
You can create a new/blank object by using `new`. For example: 
    `var hotel = new Object();`

To update a function you would use dot notation or square brackets. For example:
    `hotel.name = 'Park ; `

`delete` can be used to delete a property. For example:
    `delete hotel.name;`

Creating many objects: page 108-109. 

You can review recap of ways to create objects on page 113. 

**Arrays are objects**. You can combine arrays and objects to create complex data structures. (page 119)

Broswers have three  built in Objects: Browser Object Model, Document Object Model, and Global JavaScript Objects. 

Global Math Object:
  * `Math.PI` = returns pi
  * `Math.round()` = Rounds number to the nearest integer
  * `Math.sqrt(n)` = returns square root of positive number
  * `Math.ceil()` = rounds number up to the nearest integer
  * `Math.floor()` = rounds number down to the neares integer
  * `Math.randon()` = generates a randon number betweeen 0 and 1
