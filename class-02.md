# Introudcing CSS
<q>The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element. 
<br  />
CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and contents of that box) is presented </q>
<br  /> 
Ducket PG 229-230
<p> You can use CSS internally in HTML by using `<style` within HTML or externally by referencing `<link>` </p>
<p> CSS is read from top to bottom so *last rule* usually gets precedence if two or more rules apply to the same element. **Specificity** is also considered, the more specific rule takes precedence over general ones. Last, you can place a `!` after any property value to indicate it should be considered more important than other rules that apply to the same element. 


# Cheatsheet

* headings from biggest to smallest = `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>`
* paragraph = `<p></p>`
* bold and italic = `<b></b>` and `<i></i>`
* supercript and subscript = `<sup></sup>` and `<sub></sub>` example: CO<sub>2</sub>
* line break = `<br  />`
* blockquote = `<blockquote></blockquote>`
* shorter quotes that sit within paragrahs = `<q></q>`
* changes to content = `<ins>,</ins>`, `<del></del>`, `<s></s>`
