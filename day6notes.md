# JavaScript

## What is JS?
JS is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages, like prompting a question which would require user input. 


## Useful information

- When the browser encounters JS, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom. This means you need to be careful what order you put things in.

- Much like CSS, it is best practice to add an external sheet by adding "<script src="script.js" defer></script>" in HTML file

- It is important to define variable first before to "introduce" it like i.e "let variable = 1" <-- use single quotes as that is the standard for vanilla JS

- JavaScript operators allow us to perform tests, do math, join strings together, and other such things.

- You can also use the + operator to join text strings together (in programming, this is called **concatenation**).

- **Use console.log(variable); to output**
